This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and trying to access the `takePictureAsync` method. The issue is that the `takePictureAsync` method does not consistently return a valid URI to the captured image. Sometimes, the returned URI is `null` or undefined, leading to errors when trying to display the image or upload it. This seems to happen more often on Android devices, and sometimes, the app crashes without any apparent errors.
