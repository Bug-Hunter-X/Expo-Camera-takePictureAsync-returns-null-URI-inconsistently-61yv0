# Expo Camera takePictureAsync Inconsistent URI Return

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Camera API where the `takePictureAsync` method inconsistently returns a null or undefined URI for the captured image. This issue is particularly noticeable on Android devices. The bug and a potential solution are provided.

## Bug Description
The `takePictureAsync` method, used to capture images, sometimes returns a null URI, leading to errors and potential crashes when trying to process the image.  The inconsistency makes it unreliable for image capture in applications.

## Solution
The solution involves adding error handling and ensuring the URI is valid before proceeding with image processing.  Additional checks could also include verifying the file's existence.
